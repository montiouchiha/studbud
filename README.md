Notes:
- I could not for the life of me figure out how to display the input from the pop up menu.
- Website responsiveness is poor.
- Task list lacks finer design refinements.
- No sort functionality for Task list.
- Covey Quadrants do not exist.


Final Statement about the assignment.
- Ironically, when creating a time management application, I had poor time management and thus did not get to implement my final features.
